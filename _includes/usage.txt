    --templates        produce a list of defined templates
    --genmodules       for any template specifications (template:comictag),
                       write a snippet to comictag.pl in the directory
                       specified by --genout.
    --genout dir       output directory for generated comics.

By default, it will produce a page with the given comics on stdout.

comic_id can be:
  - Any of the predefined modules (e.g. sinfest, adam_at_home)
  - Of the form 'template:comic title', including quotes if the title has
    spaces (e.g. 'gocomis.com:Citizen Dog', comics.com:Frazz). This will
    generate on the fly a module for the given comic.
  - Of the form 'template:*' or 'template:', which means "all the comics
    from the named template". This can also be passed as argument to
    the --list and --htmllist options to produce the listing from the
    given template instead of from the built-in modules.
